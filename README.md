# Lights
This project is to control christmas tree lights.
This uses the FASTLED library to control the WS2812 lights.

## Arduino Setup
It is designed so far to be on an Arduino Uno, but should be able to be changed to any arduino.

You will, so far, need to also wire up to momentary buttons and a potentiometer, as well as the LIGHTS.

## Physical Setup
A project box of some description should be used, as there is a need to have a large external power supply with enough power to supply approx .3 WATTS per globe. At 700 lights, that's a fair whack of power!
